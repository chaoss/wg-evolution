## Code Development

Goal: Identify how effective the community is at merging new code into the codebase.

Metric | Question
--- | ---
[Pull Requests Merged](../../metrics/pull-requests-merged.md) | What is the number of code commits?
[Lines of Code Changed](../../metrics/code-lines-of-code-changed.md) | What is the number of lines of code changed?
[Code Reviews](../../metrics/pull-requests-code-reviews.md) | What is the number of code reviews?
[Pull Request Merge Duration](../../metrics/pull-requests-merge-duration.md) | What is the duration of time between code merge request and code commit?
[Code Review Efficiency](../../metrics/pull-requests-code-reviews-efficiency.md) | What is the number of merged code changes/number of abandoned code change requests?
[Maintainer Response to Merge Request Duration](../../metrics/pull-requests-maintainer-response-duration.md) | What is the duration of time for a maintainer to make a first response to a code merge request?
[Code Review Iteration](../../metrics/pull-requests-code-reviews-iteration.md) | What is the number of iterations that occur before a merge request is accepted or declined?
[Forks](../../metrics/forks.md) | Forks are a concept in distributed version control systems like GitHub. It is a proxy for the approximate number of developers who have taken a shot at building and deploying the codebase *for development*.
[Pull Requests Open](../../metrics/pull-requests-open.md) | Number of open pull requests.
[Pull Requests Closed](../../metrics/pull-requests-closed.md) | Number of closed pull requests.
[Pull Request Comment Duration](../../metrics/pull-requests-comment-duration.md) | The difference between the timestamp of the pull request creation date and the most recent comment on the pull request.
[Pull Request Comment Diversity](../../metrics/pull-requests-participants.md) | Number of each people discussing each pull request.
[Pull Request Comments](../../metrics/pull-requests-comments.md) | Number of comments on each pull request.

**Disclaimer:**
The name/question pairs listed are not meant to represent a fully comprehensive list. It is expected that this list will evolve as people have insights and thoughts about the name/question pairs that comprise Growth-Maturity-Decline.

**Tooling:**
The name/question pairs are intended to be a starting point for CHAOSS-related software. It is expected that this list will evolve based on the ability (or inability) of software to successfully implement the specific name/question pairs.

**Background:**
The name/question pairs have been identified based CHAOSS-related outreach activities. We thank everyone who participated.

**How to contribute:**
- To advance the document, fork the repo, make your changes and create a pull request.
- To ask questions or make comments open an [issue on GitHub][issue] or join the discussion on the [mailing list or weekly calls](https://chaoss.community/participate/).
