Goal: Learn about the types and frequency of activities involved in developing code.

Name | Question
--- | ---
[Code Changes](../metrics/Code_Changes.md) | What changes were made to the source code during a specified period?
[Code Changes Lines](../metrics/Code_Changes_Lines.md) | What is the sum of the number of lines touched (lines added plus lines removed) in all changes to the source code during a certain period?

**Disclaimer:**

**Tooling:**
The name/question pairs are intended to be a starting point for CHAOSS-related software. It is expected that this list will evolve based on the ability (or inability) of software to successfully implement the specific name/question pairs.

**Background:**
The name/question pairs have been identified based CHAOSS-related outreach activities. We thank everyone who participated.
