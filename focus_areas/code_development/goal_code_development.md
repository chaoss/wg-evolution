[Code Reviews](detail_metrics_methods/code_development/pull-requests-code-reviews.md) | What is the number of code reviews?
[Pull Request Merge Duration](detail_metrics_methods/code_development/pull-requests-merge-duration.md) | What is the duration of time between code merge request and code commit?
[Code Review Efficiency](detail_metrics_methods/code_development/pull-requests-review-efficiency.md) | What is the number of merged code changes/number of abandoned code change requests?

**Disclaimer:**
The name/question pairs listed are not meant to represent a fully comprehensive list. It is expected that this list will evolve as people have insights and thoughts about the name/question pairs that comprise Growth-Maturity-Decline.

**Tooling:**
The name/question pairs are intended to be a starting point for CHAOSS-related software. It is expected that this list will evolve based on the ability (or inability) of software to successfully implement the specific name/question pairs.

**Background:**
The name/question pairs have been identified based CHAOSS-related outreach activities. We thank everyone who participated.

**How to contribute:**
- To advance the document, fork the repo, make your changes and create a pull request.
- To ask questions or make comments open an [issue on GitHub][issue] or join the discussion on the [mailing list or weekly calls](https://chaoss.community/participate/).
