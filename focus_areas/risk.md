# [Area of Analysis]: Risk in Open Source Software Portfolio Management

**Question:** What are the sources of risk that need to be evaluated in the management of open source projects and open source project portfolios.

**Note**: The risk focus area is operating administratively under the Growth, Maturity and Decline working group.  At the time these discussions evolve and include a larger community of participants this focus area may become its own CHAOSS working group. 


## 1. Description

Risk is an expression of the likelihood and impact of different events on the space you are responsible for. In the case of an open source project community manager, the risks might include license risk, sustainability risk, safety risk (i.e. safety critical systems), competitive risk or community deformation risk. For a company managing an open source software portfolio, the risks are similarly license risk, and competitive risks.

## 2. Sample Objectives

- Express the risks associated with incorporating and contributing to open source software projects.
- Identify metrics related to security risk detection and management
- Identify licensing risks, including file level licensing. 
- Identify risks related to safety critical systems, for example, full coverage testing. 
- Identity sustainability risks.  These may be derivatives of growth, maturity and decline metrics. 


## 3. Sample Strategies

- Maintain awareness of the license types in a portfolios
- Maintain awareness of the competitive landscape
- Inventory of testing strategies to determine code coverage
- Enumerate community manager level security risk metrics
- Provide a dashboard of sustainability metrics


## 4. Sample Success Metrics
_Qualitative_

- File level license coverage
- Security reporting, awareness and mitigation coverage
- Community health and sustainability classification: Green, Yellow, Red
- Test coverage, safety critical systems

_Quantitative_

- A detailed enumeration of the specific licenses used in a project and a project's dependencies.
