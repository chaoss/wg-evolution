# Roadmap: CHAOSS GMD WG Goals for 2019

## Problem Statement: 

A wealth of data can be obtained from software development repositories,
which could be useful to better understand the projects running them.
But it is not obvious how to obtain relevant metrics from that data,
in a way that is useful and actionable.

## Mission (overarching goal):

GMD work group is developing metrics, methodologies, and software
for expressing open source project health and sustainability.
By measuring open source project health and sustainability,
GMD (Growth-Maturity-Decline) seeks to improve the transparency of open source project
health and sustainability so that relevant stakeholders can
make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.

## Risks:

* No one wants to use GMD metrics.
* No other software implements GMD metrics.
* Use cases do not resonate with people.

## Goals

### Goal #0: Make the boundaries of the GMD Focus area more clear and specific

### Goal #1: Fully Implemented Focus Areas

We have to produce a full version with all the metrics for at least some of the focus areas.

* We are aiming to have at least one of the focus areas implemented from top to bottom
by February, including reference implementations. Thus area will be code development.

* We are aiming to produce metrics for the next CHAOSSCon (February), in at least 2 focus areas.

* We are aiming to release formally version 1 of the metrics by Summer.

### Goal #2: Make focus areas consistent with use cases

Use cases may not immediately apply to a specific area,
so they can be specified without being in a focus area at first. 

Focus areas already take into account some use cases,
and this list of use cases that apply can be enumerated under
the focus area (and cross referenced where applicable),
and then elaborated as full use cases later. 

* We are aiming to list use cases for each focus area.

* We are aiming to identify candidate focus areas for existing use cases. 

* We are aiming in general to make focus areas and use cases more consistent with each other.
Through a process of zooming out (enumerated use cases)
and zooming in (elaborating specific use cases),
the focus areas will become more consistent with use cases and vice versa. 

### Goal #3: System status document/dashboard

We need a way to know which metrics are implemented by CHAOSS projects,
a kind of a dashboard or tables in a document where people can quickly
understand which metrics are already implemented.

* We are aiming at lists of concrete implementations of CHAOSS metrics
in Augur and GrimoireLab.

* We are aiming to have reference implementations for as much of the metrics
as possible, in the implementation directory.

### Goal #4: Have more use cases

We need use cases to inform how people are using, or intending to use,
metrics for understanding their projects.
This should be one of the sources of information to write our
goal-question-metric analysis in the focus areas documents.

* We are aiming to have more use cases fully described.

### Goal #5:  Grow the work group

To make the work in the group sustainable and representive of the CHAOSS project,
we need to nurture and help the working group to grow.

* We are aiming to recruit and engage more contributors.

* We are aiming to write and improve onboarding documents.
