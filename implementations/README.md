# Examples of implementations for metrics

Notebooks, built on top of data collected by Perceval,
for illustrating how to compute different metrics of the Evolution Working Group. The notebooks will be explanatory in regard to the analysis performed. They should help the user understand how to calculate these metrics, as well as to understand how the metric is defined. 
  
The contents of this directory are the notebooks, as well as some scripts in the scripts directory. The scripts directory is a package containing the following modules:  

- **Metric.py**:     
This file has the root class, Metric. All other classes inherit from it. It takes JSON data collected by Perceval and converts it into a form easier to analyze: like a dataframe, or a list of dictionaries.  

- **Category modules (Commit.py, PullRequest.py and Issue.py)**:  
These classes provide basic functionality which is common to all metric classes working on the same category of data: commits, issues or pull request. 

- **Individual Metric classes**:  
These are python scripts converted from the reference implementation notebooks. They inherit from the Category modules, but have the most important function of all --- to calculate values for the metrics they represent.   

To summarize, the structure of the implementations is like so:
```
Root class (Metric.py) <- Category classes (Commit.py, for example) <- Metric classes
```

### Note
- To make it easier to understand these implementations, one basic assumption is that each metric is computed for all data in the file, and currently, not for each repository. Remember that the JSON file analyzed can have data from several different sources appended to it. 
- Another assumption is that the JSON data file has data points of the same category, that is, all of them must belong to exactly one of the commit, issue or pull_request categories.

# How to run the notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chaoss/wg-gmd/master?filepath=implementations)

You can run the notebooks directly in [Binder](https://mybinder.org):
Just click on the "launch binder" logo.

You can also run the notebooks locally on your computer.
For that, you need a Python3 environment with certain modules installed
(it is recommended to use a virtual environment,
  see [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).
To install the modules, just use pip3:

```bash
$ pip install jupyter
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install perceval
```

(check at the beginning of each notebook just in case more modules need to be installed).

Clone this repository and change directory to where this notebook resides:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd
$ cd wg-gmd/implementations
```

Then launch Jupyter from the command line...

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will launch the Jupyter kernel, and will open your default browser
with the directory with all the notebooks loaded.
Click on the notebook you want to run, and you're ready to go.
More detailed instructions can be found in
[Introducing the Notebook Serverâ€™s Command Line Options](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html).

Once you have the notebook in your browser, you can execute the selected cell
by clicking \[CTRL\]\[Enter\], or \[Shift\]\[Enter\]. In the latter case,
the current cell will be run, and the next one will be selected.
For selecting any cell, just click on it.

So, if you want to execute the whole dashboard, just select the first cell,
and click \[Shift\]\[Enter\] until you're done.
You can also click on the Cell menu, and select "Run All",
which will also run all the cells in the notebook.
More details can be found in [Executing a notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/stable/execute.html#executing-a-notebook).

If you want to modify any cell, just click on it, look for the cursor,
and start writing.
