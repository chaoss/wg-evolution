{"backend_name":"GitHub","backend_version":"0.17.4","category":"issue","data":{"assignee":null,"assignee_data":{},"assignees":[],"assignees_data":[],"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Main problem is the identification of variables.\nIt was too lenient in the first take because it didn't require the a space to exist (e.g. between `int` and `name` in `int name;`).\n\nI am not super happy with the current solution (repeating the \"generics, dots, commas blalba\" regex and check for a space in between), but I'm at a loss for better alternatives. The way it was before didn't work with generics (see comment in #47). At least this works in all cases.\n\nThe issue in #47 is different with this PR. E.g. example (row 13) below gets\n- `meta.definition.variable.java storage.type.java` on `Rectangle2D` (correct) \n- `meta.definition.variable.java punctuation.separator.period.java` on `.` (correct)\n- `meta.definition.variable.java variable.other.property.java` on `Double` (while correct, I'd like to se `storage.type.java` here too)\n- `meta.definition.variable.java variable.other.definition.java` on `d` (correct)\n\nSo much better, just a minor wrinkle to iron out.\n\nExample:\n![screen shot 2016-06-13 at 2 23 17 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/933880/16007388/66230ab8-3172-11e6-9851-634d1aeac77e.png)\n","closed_at":"2016-06-13T22:41:25Z","comments":4,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tested this out and couldn't find anything wrong!

That's what the [language-html package has done](https://github.com/atom/language-html/blob/master/snippets/language-html.cson#L384).

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nThis PR fixes issue with declaring static initializer as opposed to instance/method initializer. Currently if you write this in Java class:\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n  static HashSet<Integer> set = ...\r\n  static {\r\n    set.add(1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe inside of initializer is not highlighted correctly (see image below), and treated as partially written method syntax.\r\n\r\nNote that instance/method initializers work correctly, pattern just does not understand `static` modifier prefix. I fixed by adding new pattern `static-initializer` that is built from `anonymous-block-and-instance-initializer` and `static` keyword, and added it into `class-body` scope. Also added tests for static/instance/method initializers.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"480\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/21488879/971ebd84-cc49-11e6-90fb-7789ddcf12ba.png\">\r\n<img width=\"493\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/21488883/9dbcc1ae-cc49-11e6-9c49-e07801d21e6e.png\">\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nI considered first to add `static-initializer` totally separately with its own syntax, but that introduces more code changes and duplicates the effort of having two code blocks that handle the same functionality, really. I was also thinking about just modifying `anonymous-block-and-instance-initializer` itself to handle `static` in front of it, but thought that capturing optional group was not the best approach (could not see examples in existing code either).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nFixes highlighting of static initializers.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nPossibly breaks other parts of code, though it passes unit-tests.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nCurrently there is a bug/feature of highlighting `static` inside method body. \r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n  public void func() {\r\n    static {\r\n      int a = 1;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis happens in master branch, compiler complains about this code. I am not sure if this is expected, and/or I need to fix it in this PR.\r\n","closed_at":"2016-12-31T00:34:06Z","comments":4,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu @noseglid Could you please review this PR?

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nIn released version of Atom 1.13.0 and in current master branch there is an issue when expression inside `if (...)` is parsed as generics when capitalized variable is used with `<` and some other combinations, see screen shots below. This can even affect all subsequent highlighting as shown on image below (with string). For most part it is merely minor, out of ordinary highlighting of variables, not critical at all.\r\n\r\n![java-generic-overlap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22488847/2c89f244-e879-11e6-9b5b-341156067eeb.png)\r\n![java-generic-overlap-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22488858/40302dd6-e879-11e6-82f1-639205447315.png)\r\n\r\n- Examples that break hightlighting: `if (A < a) { ... }`, `if (A < a && b < a) { ... }`, and `if (A < a || b > a) { ... }`\r\n- Examples that work: `if (a < A) { ... }`, `if (a < b) { ... }`\r\n\r\nI tried fixing most of the cases, currently I make sure that generic ends up on the same line. From what I have seen people keep generics expression on single line, and thought it would be a fair assumption to make. Code **does not fix** situations with logical operators, e.g. `&&`, `||`.  I also added tests for generics, which I think could be useful even if PR is closed (I can add tests separately).\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![java-generic-overlap-after-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22489094/6f8a7b8a-e87a-11e6-86de-d4b6b36a436e.png)\r\n![java-generic-overlap-after-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/22489099/71b706f8-e87a-11e6-82ab-19f355aaa641.png)\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nAs an alternative approach I was considering capturing `condition-block` similar to other patterns like `try-catch`, so we know that everything inside that block can be variable names and/or operators only. This would fix all cases above. I did not make the change for a reason of not being such critical at the moment and also wanted to hear from community, and discuss/approve approaches.  \r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nCurrent solution is simple, alternative would require more code, but it would cover all cases and potentially more robust to further changes (+ easy to maintain over long regex).\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nMy change might affect some other untested cases.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here -->\r\n","closed_at":"2017-02-03T19:01:40Z","comments":7,"comments_data":[{"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@50Wliu @noseglid could you review please?
