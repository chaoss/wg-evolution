# Contribution Attribution

**Question:** Who has contributed to an open-source project, and what attribution information about people and organizations is assigned for contributions?

## Overview
This metric evaluates the individuals and organizations contributing to a project and attributes specific contributions to them. By measuring who contributes and under what sponsorship (volunteer vs. sponsored), this metric offers insights into the dynamics of how work gets done in a community. Understanding contribution attribution is essential for assessing the health and sustainability of a project by recognizing active contributors and tracking the influence of organizational support on the community. Objectives include:
1. Who is working on the project?
2. What is the ratio of volunteer work, sponsored work, and blended work?
3. How many contributions are sponsored?
4. Who is sponsoring the contributions?
5. What [types of contributions](https://chaoss.community/metric-types-of-contributions/) are sponsored?
6. [How diverse is the community of contributors working on a project?](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/tree/master/demographic-data)
