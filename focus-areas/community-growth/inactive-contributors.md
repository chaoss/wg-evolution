# Inactive Contributors

**Question: How many Contributors have gone inactive over a specific period of time?**

## Overview

Inactive Contributors measures how many contributors have stopped contributing over a specific period of time. The period of time required for a contributor to be counted as inactive can be decided by a variable and this metric will display the number of contributors that have been labelled as inactive over a given time frame. The variables are 1. a time period and 2. a interval. The time period will be the period over which the number of inactive members will be displayed. For example if time period = year, then it will display the number of contributors that have gone inactive each year. The interval will determine how long it takes for a contributor to be labeled as inactive. If a contributor has not made a contribution for a length of time longer than the interval, they will be counted as inactive. The metric will work by: getting a list of all contributors, checking the last contribution date, if the last contribution date is before the cutoff then add them to the inactivity count of the period they last contributed in and create list of inactive contributors
