# New Contributors

Question:  How many contributors are making their first contribution to a given project and who are they?

## Description
An increase or decline in new contributors can be an early indicator of project health. Understanding the behavior and barriers of new community members requires knowing who they are -- helping to welcome new contributors and thank them for their efforts.

This is a specific implementation of the [Contributors](https://chaoss.community/metric-contributors/) metric.


## Objectives
An increase or decline in new contributors can be an early indicator of project health. Understanding the behavior and barriers of new community members requires knowing who they are. Welcome new contributors and thank them for their first contribution.


## Implementation
For each [Contributor](https://chaoss.community/metric-contributors/), only consider their first contribution.


### Filters
Period of Time: When was the first contribution made.

By location of engagement. For example:
* Repository authors
* Issue authors
* Code review participants
* Mailing list authors
* Event participants
* IRC authors
* Blog authors
* By release cycle
* Timeframe of activity in the project, e.g, find new contributors
* Programming languages of the project
* Role or function in project

Stage of engagement (e.g., opening pull request vs. getting it accepted).
