# New Contributors

**Question:** How many contributors are making their first contribution to a given project and who are they?

## Overview
This metric measures the number of new contributors making their first contribution to a project, offering insight into the project's growth and engagement. Tracking new contributors helps in understanding patterns of participation and potential barriers to engagement, providing opportunities for community support, onboarding, and outreach. A steady influx of new contributors may indicate a healthy, inviting project, while declines can be a signal for potential challenges in engagement or accessibility. This is a specific implementation of the [Contributors](https://chaoss.community/metric-contributors/) metric.

  * Repository authors
  * Issue authors
  * Code review participants
  * Mailing list authors
  * Event participants
  * IRC authors
  * Blog authors
  * By release cycle
  * Timeframe of activity in the project, e.g, find new contributors
  * Programming languages of the project
- **Project Phase**: Track the contributorâ€™s stage, from opening a pull request to acceptance.
- **Contributor Role**: Determine the function or role within the project (e.g., code author, reviewer, event organizer).
