# Issue Age

**Question: How long have open issues been left open?**

## Overview

Issue Age measures how long issues have been left open in the considered time period. Data points are calculated from the initial opening date of each issue until its closure or the end of the measurement period. Increasing issue age can indicate delays in development, fewer contributors, or problems that requires attention. Identifying the oldest open issues  gives insight into why they have been open for an extended period of time and how quickly issues are resolved.
