# Issue Creation

Question: Who is creating new issues?

## Description
This metric should give some light to who is creating the direction of a project's development. By aggregating the creators for issues, we can see who is in charge of finding bugs as well as deciding on new features.
The metric should give a name and contact for each issue, as well as showing top issue creators and most open issues per creator.

## Objectives
By seeing who is creating new issues, we are able to determine how workload is being distributed and could even determine importance of an issue by the individual that submitted it.

### Filters (optional)
Include a Filter

### Visualizations (optional)
Include visualizations such as screenshot of the metric. There may be many more visualizations for this metric, we only want to provide a flavor for what this metric is about.

### Tools Providing the Metric (optional)
Metric must be currently deployed/available, in contrast to a tool having the "potential" to provide the metric. Provide direct link to implementation/documentation, if applicable

### Data Collection Strategies (Optional)
If there are several different ways to collect data for this metric, list them here.
This may include expressing a metric in different ways.
