# Issue Creation

Question: Who is creating new issues?

## Description
This metric should give some light to who is creating the direction of a project's development. By aggregating the creators for issues, we can see who is in charge of finding bugs as well as deciding on new features.
The metric should give a name and contact for each issue, as well as showing top issue creators and most open issues per creator.

## Objectives
By seeing who is creating new issues, we are able to determine how workload is being distributed and could even determine importance of an issue by the individual that submitted it. We should display individuals that are creating the most issues, categories of issues being created for each user, and the time to completion of an average issues by the creator.

## Implementation
