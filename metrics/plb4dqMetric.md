Question:What are the comments that are put on certain sections of code?

## Description
Gives us the comments on different projects on different parts of codes, and what they say and how many there are.

## Objectives
The goal is to see what comments were posted when and what they are so you can keep up to date on the latest comments to make sure you are up to date with what is happening. It also allows you to see how many are in each part of the code.

## Implementation
It would iterate through the code and have a counter to count the amount of comments it finds and look for the key characters that dictate a comment and pull out the info after it to display the comment to the user.
