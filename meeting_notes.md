### Agenda
1. Review in progress use cases
2. Review any other pending pull request (if any)
3. Review other pending issues (if any)
4. Start discussion on defining, top-down, the first focus area.

### Minutes:

#### Use Case Discussion

* Use Cases are not necessarily generalized. They should be specific to the individual or organizations that create it.
* Where do use cases fit in the cycle?
  * GMD work would be to generalize these use cases into goals and questions
* Moving issue 33 from issue state to PR state and continue discussion
  * https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/33


#### Review Pull requests
* [Adding a new section to Use Cases](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pull/40) (merged).

#### Review Pending issues
* Issues are visited, but no specific action is needed on them.

#### Focus Area Discussion
We have decided to start working, with the top-down approach, on the "code development" focus area.
Contribution is a broader topic

* Narrow focus – code (this is about code)
* Define scope & and identify goal
* Question - We want to understand code contributions...
* Factors related to code contributions
  * Velocity
  * Quality
    * Processes for quality? – tests (signal of quality)
    * Presence or absence of code reviews – converge of code reviews?

### Action items
* New Issue - fix metrics folder links - Assigned to Jesus
* New issue – Create focus area (code development) and define scope/identify goals - Assigned to Jesus
  *  Jesus [opens a ticket to start the work](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/44)

Jaice

### Agenda:
1. Discuss Pull Requests
2. New Items?

### Minutes:

#### Discussion of Pull Request: [README] Proposal for a more informative README.md #36

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pull/36

* In the past Perceval chosen for example reference implementation
  * There may be some implementations that don’t use Perceval, but not reference implementations

* Is there a relationship between use cases and goal question metrics?
  * Use cases may be used for the goal and questions at a later date but this may need refinement

Decision to keep text as is with the understanding that the process may need refining

#### Pull requests

* Pull request 21 closed and resubmitted as 39
* Merged - 39, 38, 37, 36, 34, and 32

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

#### Discussion of Issue - Use Case: Efficiency in reviewing contributions from first-time contributors ##33

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/33

A first-time contributor could be easily discouraged if no one reviews/acknowledges their work in a timely manner. Following are number of questions that can help evaluate responsiveness for first-time contributors.

* New contributors vs everybody else or do we have to distinguish between and define what a core contributor is and etc…
  * Easy to define if we focus on new contributors

* What metrics are included? – Issues? Pull requests?
  * Contributor often means issues and code

* Need a section on vocabulary
  * informal definitions
  * Example: what is a contributor?
  * Define terms in layman terms rather than metrics terms

* Encouragement to all members of the working group to join the discussion in this issue
(and later in the corresponding pull request).

#### Discussion from General Meeting
* Risk and Value aren’t getting much attention
* Decision to move Risk and Value into GMD workgroup
* List Risk and Value as Focus Areas within GMD

### Notes
Please use tags in issues and pull requests. New tag `use case`.

### Action items

* Edit use case template to include vocabulary section – assigned to Jesus
* Explain GMD in README – assigned to Sean
* Add Risk and Value as Focus Area –  assigned to Sean

-------------

## Wednesday, October 24th
9:00 am PDT / 18:00 CEST

### Agenda:

1. Discuss meeting weekly on the agenda... maybe meeting weekly with a monthly meeting to make final decisions ...
2. Discuss Pending Pull Requests
https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pulls
3. New Items to Discuss or Questions
4. Actionable Items

### Minutes:

#### Use Case Discussion
How can expert users contribute use cases
* Google doc (D&I) - Edit use cases in google docs?
* Blog post?
* Pull Requests to Repository
* Work done in the open?
* Need consistency
* Keep use cases close to the user not necessarily aligned with the workgroup
* Use Case Format?
  * Typically have 7 or 8 headings
  * Use case structure that SPDX uses
https://github.com/spdx/spdx-github/wiki/Webhook-Use-Case

#### Workflow Discussion
There should be consistency in work flows and should be documented.
* Procedures file?
* How to contribute document?
https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* We need an actual workflow document
  * How to contribute procedurally and how to actually do stuff? - Process and structure.
* Add contribute messages to documents

Last meeting we discussed moving from a bottom-up approach (defining metrics/methods then creating questions goals and use cases) to a top-down approach (defining questions then creating use cases and metrics/methods as needed). However discussions can still continue on metrics/methods.

#### Metrics Methods Discussion
* Issues are a little different in Bugzilla vs GitHub
  * How can we map to these ideas? Trying to be precise.
* Discussion of issues.open.md
  * Time and Aggregation period?
  * File name changed creating a merge conflict for pull request

Add a description of what we consider a GMD metric to README.
To avoid conflicts with other work groups. This is the kind of metrics we are talking about

#### Proposed Meeting Time Change
Move from bi-weekly to weekly meetings
* Meet every Wednesday
* Open forum every week and monthly meeting where decisions are made
* Deciding meeting/Formal meeting is last meeting of each month

#### Risk work group will work with GMD group and share meeting times

#### Action Items
* Add pull request to website and GitHub. For new meeting times.
* Remove notes from readme to separate file.
* Create template and folder for Use Cases
* Create contribute and process documents

    - Action items

  - Minutes:

    - Pending approval from missing members, GMD will adopt the D&I Framework – goals, questions, and metrics  (top down approach)
      - Moving to a top down approach starting with code development goals.md then move to questions documents.
      - Example: Code Development Goal – Understand how code changes occur in repositories, Question - How many people are involved in a change?
      - Document the process for defining metrics (Start with goals, create questions around goals, identify metrics that can answer questions, and define metrics and methods..
      - Use cases may inform new goals and how we understand the questions

    - Add Use Case Folder
      - Collect use cases from members on how they use metrics and what questions they are trying to answer
      - Rename use case header from detail metric pages to remove confusion

    - Store meeting notes and past agendas on repository

    - Quick Reference Links:
