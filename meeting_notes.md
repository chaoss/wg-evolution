Georg Link
Kevin Lumbard

### Agenda
1. Review in progress use cases
2. Review any other pending pull request (if any)
3. Review other pending issues (if any)
4. Start discussion on defining, top-down, the first focus area.

### Minutes:

#### Use Case Discussion

* Use Cases are not necessarily generalized. They should be specific to the individual or organizations that create it.
* Where do use cases fit in the cycle?
  * GMD work would be to generalize these use cases into goals and questions
* Moving issue 33 from issue state to PR state and continue discussion
  * https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/33


#### Review Pull requests
* [Adding a new section to Use Cases](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pull/40) (merged).

#### Review Pending issues
* Issues are visited, but no specific action is needed on them.

#### Focus Area Discussion
We have decided to start working, with the top-down approach, on the "code development" focus area.
Contribution is a broader topic

* Narrow focus – code (this is about code)
* Define scope & and identify goal
* Question - We want to understand code contributions...
* Factors related to code contributions
  * Velocity
  * Quality
    * Processes for quality? – tests (signal of quality)
    * Presence or absence of code reviews – converge of code reviews?

### Action items
* New Issue - fix metrics folder links - Assigned to Jesus
* New issue – Create focus area (code development) and define scope/identify goals - Assigned to Jesus
  *  Jesus [opens a ticket to start the work](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/44)

Jaice

### Agenda:
1. Discuss Pull Requests
2. New Items?

### Minutes:

#### Discussion of Pull Request: [README] Proposal for a more informative README.md #36

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pull/36

* In the past Perceval chosen for example reference implementation
  * There may be some implementations that don’t use Perceval, but not reference implementations

* Is there a relationship between use cases and goal question metrics?
  * Use cases may be used for the goal and questions at a later date but this may need refinement

Decision to keep text as is with the understanding that the process may need refining

#### Pull requests

* Pull request 21 closed and resubmitted as 39
* Merged - 39, 38, 37, 36, 34, and 32

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

#### Discussion of Issue - Use Case: Efficiency in reviewing contributions from first-time contributors ##33

https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/33

A first-time contributor could be easily discouraged if no one reviews/acknowledges their work in a timely manner. Following are number of questions that can help evaluate responsiveness for first-time contributors.

* New contributors vs everybody else or do we have to distinguish between and define what a core contributor is and etc…
  * Easy to define if we focus on new contributors

* What metrics are included? – Issues? Pull requests?
  * Contributor often means issues and code

* Need a section on vocabulary
  * informal definitions
  * Example: what is a contributor?
  * Define terms in layman terms rather than metrics terms

* Encouragement to all members of the working group to join the discussion in this issue
(and later in the corresponding pull request).

#### Discussion from General Meeting
* Risk and Value aren’t getting much attention
* Decision to move Risk and Value into GMD workgroup
* List Risk and Value as Focus Areas within GMD

### Notes
Please use tags in issues and pull requests. New tag `use case`.

### Action items

* Edit use case template to include vocabulary section – assigned to Jesus
* Explain GMD in README – assigned to Sean
* Add Risk and Value as Focus Area –  assigned to Sean

-------------

## Wednesday, October 24th
9:00 am PDT / 18:00 CEST

### Agenda:

1. Discuss meeting weekly on the agenda... maybe meeting weekly with a monthly meeting to make final decisions ...
2. Discuss Pending Pull Requests
https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pulls
3. New Items to Discuss or Questions
4. Actionable Items

### Minutes:

#### Use Case Discussion
How can expert users contribute use cases
* Google doc (D&I) - Edit use cases in google docs?
* Blog post?
* Pull Requests to Repository
* Work done in the open?
* Need consistency
* Keep use cases close to the user not necessarily aligned with the workgroup
* Use Case Format?
  * Typically have 7 or 8 headings
  * Use case structure that SPDX uses
https://github.com/spdx/spdx-github/wiki/Webhook-Use-Case

#### Workflow Discussion
There should be consistency in work flows and should be documented.
* Procedures file?
* How to contribute document?
https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* We need an actual workflow document
  * How to contribute procedurally and how to actually do stuff? - Process and structure.
* Add contribute messages to documents

Last meeting we discussed moving from a bottom-up approach (defining metrics/methods then creating questions goals and use cases) to a top-down approach (defining questions then creating use cases and metrics/methods as needed). However discussions can still continue on metrics/methods.

#### Metrics Methods Discussion
* Issues are a little different in Bugzilla vs GitHub
  * How can we map to these ideas? Trying to be precise.
* Discussion of issues.open.md
  * Time and Aggregation period?
  * File name changed creating a merge conflict for pull request

Add a description of what we consider a GMD metric to README.
To avoid conflicts with other work groups. This is the kind of metrics we are talking about

#### Proposed Meeting Time Change
Move from bi-weekly to weekly meetings
* Meet every Wednesday
* Open forum every week and monthly meeting where decisions are made
* Deciding meeting/Formal meeting is last meeting of each month

#### Risk work group will work with GMD group and share meeting times

#### Action Items
* Add pull request to website and GitHub. For new meeting times.
* Remove notes from readme to separate file.
* Create template and folder for Use Cases
* Create contribute and process documents

    - Action items

  - Minutes:

    - Pending approval from missing members, GMD will adopt the D&I Framework – goals, questions, and metrics  (top down approach)
      - Moving to a top down approach starting with code development goals.md then move to questions documents.
      - Example: Code Development Goal – Understand how code changes occur in repositories, Question - How many people are involved in a change?
      - Document the process for defining metrics (Start with goals, create questions around goals, identify metrics that can answer questions, and define metrics and methods..
      - Use cases may inform new goals and how we understand the questions

    - Add Use Case Folder
      - Collect use cases from members on how they use metrics and what questions they are trying to answer
      - Rename use case header from detail metric pages to remove confusion

    - Store meeting notes and past agendas on repository

    - Quick Reference Links:

  - Video of the meeting: https://youtu.be/A31mGjBM2Io
    GMD work processes need to be ironed out ( Branch vs Separate Repo)
  - Minutes:
    - There are pros and cons for working in a Branch vs a Separate Repo.
Arguments can be made in the mailing list and we can vote or reply to reach consensus.
There is an existing thread on this topic.
    - Pending pull request merge: Use Case for detail metric forks
    - File name conventions and repo structure. Consensus on renaming
    - Some commments about Kibble and CHAOSS. Kibble examples and use Cases.
Metric Format issues.
Kibble already has code written and visualization so no sense in using Jupyter Notebook?
Are there precise definitions of kibble metrics?
Need to ensure that the definitions and methods for calculating metrics are the same or if different, it is understood why.  
Want to see if Kibble is aligned with GMD
    - We need volunteers for the use case blog – please see the
    [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9FZM6rixjiEsxXQ7Ij-mbGCJKm_OrOQ6nd3oIBRnto/edit?usp=sharing)

-------------------

## September 12, 2018

  - Agenda:
    - Discuss possibly moving our project repository into a branch off of the metrics repository in order to facilitate easier long term integration
    - Metadata questions from last meeting. Review associated pull requests
    - Document contribution and prototyping process.
    - Review metrics status dashboard.

* We had some other meetings, see mailing list archives for agendas / minutes / links to videos.
