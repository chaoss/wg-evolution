## Introduction

_Growth, Maturity and Decline_ is a working group focused on the lifecycle of open source projects. We do not valence the stages, but seek to build awareness of those stages among consumers of these metrics. Decline can be ok when a project's utility is waning; or terrible if 20% of the entire internet relies on that project. Context matters, and we are not the arbiters of your context. The "valence" of "good/bad" emerges from use cases and YOUR context.

This is a [wg-diversity-inclusion](https://chaoss.community) working group, focused on the [Growth-Maturity-Decline][gmd] metrics category. Its aim is to coordinate the definition of the metrics, and the production of software for implementing them, in this area.

This group meets every Wednesday at 11am CST. [Connection Information and minutes from previous meetings are located here.](./meeting_notes.md)

Focus areas for this working group include metrics related to ;
1. Growth Maturity and Decline
  * [Code Code Development](./focus_areas/code_development.md)
  * [Community Growth](./focus_areas/community_growth.md)
  * [Issue Resolution](./focus_areas/issue_resolution.md)
2. [Risk](./focus_areas/risk/risk.md)
3. [Value](./focus_areas/value/value.md)

# How to participate

You can start by introducing yourself on the CHAOSS mailing list (see below) explaining your interest. Then, you can have a look at the archives of the mailing lists, at the minutes of past meetings, and at the
- [issues](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues) and
- [pull requests](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pulls) in
- [this repository](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd).

Then, of course you can participate in the mailing list, in online meetings, and in issues and pull requests. [Mailing lists can be subscribed to here.](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss)

Currently, main lines of work are:

* [Use cases](use_cases). Proposal and discussion of use cases that help to understand metrics in context.
You can propose your use cases, and/or contribute to refine those that have been proposed already.

* Focus areas (definitions, goals, questions). Currently, in the [definition of GMD metrics] we strucuture
it in the following focus areas: [Issue Resolution](focus_areas/issue_resolution.md), [Code Development](focus_areas/code_development.md), and [Community Growth](focus_areas/communitiy_growth.md).

For each area of interest, we're following the [goal-question-metric methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM) defining questions and metrics that help to answer them.

You can contribute by proposing new goals for a focus area, or new questions for learning about those goals,
or new metrics for answering those questions. Or by helping to refine goals, and questions.
