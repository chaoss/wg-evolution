# What is this working group about?
This Working Group focused on Growth-Maturity-Decline metrics and software.

The goal is to refine the metrics that inform [Growth-Maturity-Decline][gmd] and to work with software implementations.

## Meetings

  - Attendees: Alberto García-Plaza, Jesus M. Gonzales-Barahona, Matt Germonprez,
  Sean P. Goggins (lost connection), Kevin Lumbard.
  - Video of the meeting: will be available in the
  [CHAOSS Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrG-a3hIc_hCEUWloG0gm9A)
  - Agenda:
    - Discuss ordered list of metrics to work on defining. With some degree of prioritization (perhaps keep in a markdown document)
    - Discuss [pending pull requests](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pulls)
    - New items to discuss or questions
    - Action items

  - Minutes:

    - Pending approval from missing members, GMD will adopt the D&I Framework – goals, questions, and metrics  (top down approach)
      - Moving to a top down approach starting with code development goals.md then move to questions documents.
      - Example: Code Development Goal – Understand how code changes occur in repositories, Question - How many people are involved in a change?
      - Document the process for defining metrics (Start with goals, create questions around goals, identify metrics that can answer questions, and define metrics and methods..
      - Use cases may inform new goals and how we understand the questions

    - Add Use Case Folder
      - Collect use cases from members on how they use metrics and what questions they are trying to answer
      - Rename use case header from detail metric pages to remove confusion

    - Store meeting notes and past agendas on repository

    GMD work processes need to be ironed out ( Branch vs Separate Repo)
  - Minutes:
    - There are pros and cons for working in a Branch vs a Separate Repo.
Arguments can be made in the mailing list and we can vote or reply to reach consensus.
There is an existing thread on this topic.
    - Pending pull request merge: Use Case for detail metric forks
    - File name conventions and repo structure. Consensus on renaming
    - Some commments about Kibble and CHAOSS. Kibble examples and use Cases.
Metric Format issues.
Kibble already has code written and visualization so no sense in using Jupyter Notebook?
Are there precise definitions of kibble metrics?
Need to ensure that the definitions and methods for calculating metrics are the same or if different, it is understood why.  
Want to see if Kibble is aligned with GMD
    - We need volunteers for the use case blog – please see the
    [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9FZM6rixjiEsxXQ7Ij-mbGCJKm_OrOQ6nd3oIBRnto/edit?usp=sharing)

 
* September 12, 2018

  - Agenda:
    - Discuss possibly moving our project repository into a branch off of the metrics repository in order to facilitate easier long term integration
    - Metadata questions from last meeting. Review associated pull requests
    - Document contribution and prototyping process.
    - Review metrics status dashboard. 

* We had some other meetings, see mailing list archives for agendas / minutes / links to videos.
  
* April 19, 2018 (first meeting)
