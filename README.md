# CHAOSS Evolution Working Group
Formerly known as the Growth Maturity and Decline Working Group. This repository is where new metrics are actively developed and prepared for release. Released metrics are available on the CHAOSS Website: https://chaoss.community/metrics/

The Evolution working group meets every other Wednesday at 9:00pm CDT in the [CHAOSS Zoom room](https://zoom.us/j/4998687533).
Our [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fgMT5onwvNQE6b4gPWE7oSPHRvb9q1z6XEbD51EtCFg/edit) are uploaded to the repository after each call.

## Introduction

### Purpose

_Evolution_ is a working group focused on the lifecycle of open source projects. We do not valence the stages, but seek to build awareness of those stages among consumers of these metrics. Decline can be ok when a project's utility is waning; or terrible if 20% of the entire internet relies on that project. Context matters, and we are not the arbiters of your context. The "valence" of "good/bad" emerges from use cases and YOUR context.

### Goal
Currently, the goals are structured in the following focus areas : [Code Development Activity](focus_areas/code_development_activity.md), [Code Development Efficiency](focus_areas/code_development_efficiency.md) and [Code Development Process Quality](focus_areas/code_development_process_quality.md).

### Process
For each area of interest, we're following the [goal-question-metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM) methodology defining questions and metrics that help to answer them.

## Metrics

The evolution metrics dealt with in this working group are organized in focus areas:

Focus Area | Goal
--- | ---
[Code Development Activity](./focus_areas/code_development_activity.md) | Learn about the types and frequency of activities involved in developing code.
[Code Development Efficiency](./focus_areas/code_development_efficiency.md) | Learn how efficiently activities around code development get resolved.
[Code Development Process Quality](./focus_areas/code_development_process_quality.md) | Learn about the processes to improve/review quality that are used (for example: testing, code review, tagging issues, tagging a release, time to response, CII Badging).
[Issue Resolution](./focus_areas/issue_resolution.md) | Identify how effective the community is at addressing issues identified by community participants.
[Community Growth](./focus_areas/community_growth.md) | Identify the size of the project community and whether it is growing, shrinking, or staying the same.

Please note that the work in the focus areas is still in progress.

## Contributing

A few steps as good starting points for contributing to the Evolution Working group:
* Introduce yourself on the [CHAOSS mailing list](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution#mailing-list) explaining your interest.
* Then, you can have a look at the archives of the mailing lists, at the minutes of past meetings, and at the
    * [issues](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues)
    * [pull requests](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/pulls)
    * [contents of this repository](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution).
* By proposing new goals for a focus area, or new questions for learning about those goals, or new metrics for answering those questions. Or by helping to refine goals, and questions.
