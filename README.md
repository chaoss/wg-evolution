## Introduction

_Growth, Maturity and Decline_ is a working group focused on the lifecycle of open source projects. We do not valence the stages, but seek to build awareness of those stages among consumers of these metrics. Decline can be ok when a project's utility is waning; or terrible if 20% of the entire internet relies on that project. Context matters, and we are not the arbiters of your context. The "valence" of "good/bad" emerges from use cases and YOUR context.

## Contributing

You can start by introducing yourself on the [CHAOSS mailing list](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd#mailing-list) explaining your interest. Then, you can have a look at the archives of the mailing lists, at the minutes of past meetings, and at the

* [issues](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues) and
* [pull requests](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/pulls) in
* [contents of this repository](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd).

To contribute, of course you can participate in the in online meetings, and in issues and pull requests. 
Currently, main lines of work are:

* [Use cases](use_cases). Proposal and discussion of use cases that help to understand metrics in context.
You can propose your use cases, and/or contribute to refine those that have been proposed already.

* Focus areas (definitions, goals, questions). Currently, in the [definition of GMD metrics] we strucuture
it in the following focus areas: [Issue Resolution](focus_areas/issue_resolution.md), [Code Development](focus_areas/code_development.md), and [Community Growth](focus_areas/community_growth.md).

For each area of interest, we're following the [goal-question-metric methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM) defining questions and metrics that help to answer them.

You can contribute by proposing new goals for a focus area, or new questions for learning about those goals,
or new metrics for answering those questions. Or by helping to refine goals, and questions.

See more details in the [contributing file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Meetings

The GMD working group meets frequently. Check details on when we meet, and minutes of past meetings
in the [meetings document](./meeting_notes.md).

Usually, we try to make decissions mainly during the last meeting of each month,
so that decisions can be brought when convenient to the monthtly main CHAOSS meeting,
which is the first meeting of each month. In all the meetings we may have an agenda,
but random issues can be raised if time allows, after we're done with the agenda.
Whenever possible, and specially if a decission needs to be made,
ensure that issues / pull requests about the subject matter were opened some time before the meeting,
so that anyone had the opportunity of commenting on them, and make up their mind about that subject matter.

### Mailing list

* We use the [CHAOSS mailing list](https://chaoss.community/participate/#user-content-join-the-mailing-list).
Please prefix the message subject with \[wg-gmd\] if it is specific to this working group.

## Metrics  

The metrics dealt with in this focus group are organized in focus areas:

* Growth Maturity and Decline
  * [Code Development](./focus_areas/code_development.md)
  * [Community Growth](./focus_areas/community_growth.md)
  * [Issue Resolution](./focus_areas/issue_resolution.md)
* [Risk](./focus_areas/risk.md)
* [Value](./focus_areas/value.md)

## Usage

This is a repository for the GMD working group.
When this working group decides to "release" a version of its metrics,
the relevant files will be dumped to the
[chaoss/metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics) repository,
as a pull request for updating the CHAOSS metrics with
"GMD metrics release x.y".
